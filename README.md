# Simulation IBSimu of a Ligth TOF-Mass Spectrometer 
Computational Ion Optics

Full code C++, Make compiler and Draw (CAD schematic design) to run a simulation on in Ion Optics Simulator program – Ion Beam Simulator – IBSimu, developed by T.Kalvas et al. (http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/) of a functional Time-of-Fligth Mass Spectrometer.
The spectrometer has build and performed by Impact of Electrons and Fotons Laboratory ('LIFE' in Portuguese) in Physical Chemistry Department of Chemical Institute to Federal University of Rio de Janeiro – UFRJ.- Brazil.
