Full code C++, Make compiler and Draw (CAD schematic design) to run a simulation of a functional UV-Ligth Time-of-Fligth Mass Spectrometer on ion optical computer simulation package – Ion Beam Simulator – IBSimu.

[IBSimu](http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/) has developed by T.Kalvas et al.

The spectrometer has build and performed in earlier 2000's, by Laboratory of Electrons and Fotons Impact ('[LIFE](https://www.iq.ufrj.br/laboratorios/laboratorio-de-impacto-de-fotons-e-eletrons-life/)' in Portuguese) in Department of Physical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro – UFRJ.- Brazil.

The code was based write code used in a 'RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY WITH TIME OF FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY'
