Full code C++, Make compiler and Draw (CAD schematic design) to run a simulation of a functional UV-Ligth Time-of-Fligth Mass Spectrometer on ion optical computer simulation package – Ion Beam Simulator – IBSimu.

IBSimu has developed by T.Kalvas et al. (http://ibsimu.sourceforge.net/).

The spectrometer has build and performed in earlier 2000's, by Laboratory of Electrons and Fotons Impact ('LIFE' in Portuguese) in Department of Physical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro – UFRJ.- Brazil.

The code was write based code used in a 'RESONANCE IONIZATION SPECTROSCOPY WITH TIME OF FLIGHT MASS SPECTROMETRY'
